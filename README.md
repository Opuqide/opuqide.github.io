# Tyler (Opuqide)

Hello! My name is Tyler (or you can call me Opuqide), and I am a huge Apple internal fanatic. I love to learn about Apple internal tools, software, information, and technologies! I even like to make stuff for anything! I also like to make games, modules, and other sorts of things on Roblox for just about anything!
